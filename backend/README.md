We're no strangers to Node
You know the rules and so do I
A robust commit's what I'm thinking of
You wouldn't get this from any other guy

I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
Gotta make you understand

Never gonna git push up
Never gonna pull you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna merge conflict
Never gonna say --force
Never gonna forget docs and hurt you

We've known each other for so long
Your runtime's been aching but you're too shy to say it
Inside we both know what's been going on
We know the event loop and we're gonna run it

And if you ask me my linter
Don't tell me you're too blind to see

Never gonna git push up
Never gonna pull you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna merge conflict
Never gonna say --force
Never gonna forget docs and hurt you
Never gonna git push up
Never gonna pull you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna merge conflict
Never gonna say --force
Never gonna forget docs and hurt you

Never gonna git, never gonna git
(git push up)
(Ooh) Never gonna git, never gonna git
(git push up)

We've known each other for so long
Your runtime's been aching but you're too shy to say it
Inside we both know what's been going on
We know the event loop and we're gonna run i

I just wanna tell you how I'm linting
Gotta make you understand

Never gonna git push up
Never gonna pull you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna merge conflict
Never gonna say --force
Never gonna forget docs and hurt you
Never gonna git push up
Never gonna pull you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna merge conflict
Never gonna say --force
Never gonna forget docs and hurt you
Never gonna git push up
Never gonna pull you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna merge conflict
